PrettyButEmpty,"No problem, happy to help. 

Publications can help, but mainly if they are relevant to surgery. A lot of people have undergrad research, which is great but falls more under the “positive extracurricular” category rather than being a big plus. 

Where research can help you is if you are doing it with one or more surgeons, who then know you and can write letters for you. Or if you manage to publish a paper that could essentially be a back up paper for your credentials. (When you finish your residency you will need to submit a collection of things to ACVS in order to be approved to take boards. One of the things you must submit is proof that you have completed and published a research paper in an approved journal contributing to the surgical literature.

G000dawgs,"I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat. 

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted. 

I hope you find something that works for you!!!!

Desperate-Car6229,"Definitely understand that! I think from what I’ve heard there are many different sides to the education for clinical year. I’ve heard stories from students at places with teaching hospitals who describe their clinical year as being treated as a glorified tech for free labor getting to do barely any procedures because of competition with interns and residents. 

On the other hand, I’ve talked to students from my school who during their clinical year have wracked up hundreds of surgeries under their belt, from spays and neuters to dentals, amputations, enunciations, etc… and basically running appointments by themselves, but I’ve also heard students who said they went to rotations where they didn’t get to do much or saw some not as good standard medicine. I think that the variability is probably much crazier and depends on how you plan your clinical year and what site you go to.

So I definitely see the concern and I think both have pros and cons to them!

And it seems like looking at tuition then it’s pretty comparable. I was accepted to Cornell OOS and chose to go to U of A as a resident and when I compared costs it was over 100k more. Not to mention, a three year program means that interest accrues slightly less because you graduate sooner which is a trade off with not having summer breaks .

Giraffefab19,"I think you have two main options here. First, you could go to your practice manager or practice owner with specific issues that you have and some ideas on how to fix it. Put the issues in context of how it is not just impacting how you feel but how you are able to do your job. If the construction issues don't rise to the level of impacting your ability to do your job, don't be surprised if the bosses don't jump to make major changes. If you can clearly articulate what exactly is happening, how is impacts the job, and what you think would fix it or help, then you will probably get somewhere. The other option is to wait it out. Do you have an idea of when the construction will be done? Renovating a clinic is a huge pain in the ass for everyone involved but is often really worth it in the end. I would make a list of the things that are going on that are really bugging you. Then look at the list and try to determine ""can I live with this for x more months?"" Honestly if the issues are not a huge detriment to you, I would try to stick it out. The gas leak situation is concerning... So maybe if that happens again I would bring it up with the bosses but since it is all resolved now, I don't see how bringing it up to them at this point would be productive.",i think you have two main options here first you could go to your practice manager or practice owner with specific issues that you have and some ideas on how to fix it put the issues in context of how it is not just impacting how you feel but how you are able to do your job if the construction issues dont rise to the level of impacting your ability to do your job dont be surprised if the bosses dont jump to make major changes if you can clearly articulate what exactly is happening how is impacts the job and what you think would fix it or help then you will probably get somewhere the other option is to wait it out do you have an idea of when the construction will be done renovating a clinic is a huge pain in the ass for everyone involved but is often really worth it in the end i would make a list of the things that are going on that are really bugging you then look at the list and try to determine can i live with this for x more months honestly if the issues are not a huge detriment to you i would try to stick it out the gas leak situation is concerning so maybe if that happens again i would bring it up with the bosses but since it is all resolved now i dont see how bringing it up to them at this point would be productive,Other

During the next quarter we plan to expand our team with senior marketing, accounting, legal professionals, and this is very important (thus exciting) for us in the long run. We are also ready to start collaborating with developers working remotely, - that will bring us a fresh perspective on all we do and increase our chances to find the top talent we need four our ambitious plans.

We continue working on our organisational structure and values - another thing that will have a huge impact on the team in the future.

9 times out of 10, they are correct.  

As a new doctor that never did any GP and went right into ER from day one, I can't tell you how invaluable those techs were to me.

If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). 

Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.",plenty of people do a midcareer switch to vet med there were two students in my class in their and several in their and really the biggest question is financial if you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans you are good to go if you need to take out major loans then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work figure you’ll need years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites then years of school means you’ll be in your when you graduate tuition for years will be depending on if you get into your instate school most people need to budget another for living expenses but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation own your own home have a spousepartner with a job have kids etc graduation in your you’ll have about years of working as a vet current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about for their first contract that will be up a bit in years although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures i listed many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in years and may go for an incomebased repayment plan in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after or years so if at age you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical year old student you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans,Veterinarian

MYST_team,"Hey u/nctr thanks for your questions!  
  
\- **any upcoming partnerships with other VPNs to sell them bandwidth?**  
B2B sales is not currently a focus of the Mysterium VPN team. We’re prioritizing our global userbase and providing them with the best user experience and support.  
  
**- Is currently the number of nodes or the numbers of bandwidth users (internal or from external partners?) the bottleneck? What are you doing to make it less of a bottleneck?**  
I’m unsure what you mean by bottleneck - right now Mysterium VPN team is utilizing a large number of residential IPs from Mysterium’s node network, with more locations and residential IPs than our top competitors combined. So now we just need to spread awareness of these new VPN apps and show the world what a great enhancement it is to our lives ;)   
  
**- There used to be a partnership with the Sentinel DVPN, as in allow users to use each others nodes. Is this still planned?**  
Mysterium Network collaborated with Sentinel back in the day to form the dVPN Alliance. Sentinel has since pivoted to a new network (Cosmos) while the original Mysterium Dark app uses Polygon to facilitate its P2P transactions. Something for the MystNodes team to consider in future.  
  
\- **Any plan for whitelabel VPNs? As in I create my own website, design and possibly GUI for my VPN company, but pay mysterium in the backend to be able to use their servers?** Possibly with a generic GUI that can simply be rebranded to my own brand.  
  
We use the open-source Mysterium protocol so in theory you could also create your own VPN app using a direct integration of Mysterium Node (check out their GitHub).  
  
But our team may consider white labeling our VPN 2.0 app in the future.

calliopeReddit,"Can you make that brush any broader?

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.",can you make that brush any broader what youre describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame but youre advising other people who may or may not be like you about what their experience will be like at one of over dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future i say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked but it was what i had to do in order to become a vet and being a vet is way better than being a vet student i didnt deal with a toxic environment though i did deal with a few instructors who were aholes that happens in any school or workplace thats especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine and i think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors who know how to deal with errors and imperfection perfectionism among vet students and then vets is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system imo and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession imo of course theres no support for all species groups do you have any idea how many species that would be youre upset because you didnt get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about but that disappointment is on you you should have and could have know about that before you went to vet school all you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this or studentdoctornetwork to know that niche species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school it takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine that youre not a real doctor situation youre facing sucks but its a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because its not new its been that way for years and happens even to specialists youve obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets and youve obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeinghearing how they think about vets didnt you ever see that before anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake and its unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas its one of the first things i tell people about the profession along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people not animals im sorry if youve made that mistake taking paperwork or computer work home is not common for most practitioners and in some places isnt even allowed the only vets i know who do that occasionally are owners and they dont get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do there certainly are practitioners that have to do that but thats specific to that clinic and its not common are students used as free labour of course just like in most other professional schools but thats years compared with a career of years youve got weird expectations about what privileges a professional degree should get youof course doctors like many other professionals work weekends in some jobs thats because illness and injury doesnt care whether its a weekday or weekend what did you expect not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work and not all clinics are open weekends but those that arent open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who do work weekends in afterhours and er clinics in many locations they have professional degrees too and i am thankful that theyre not too proud of their professional degree to work weekends im sorry youre dissatisfied with your career choice but i think its a good profession that has both good and bad jobs just like any profession i think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations and not broadly about vet school which sucked or veterinary medicine as a profession i expected vet school to suck and it did but i am so much happier being a vet,Medical Doctor

MikeBowden,"Yes, you can do this. I run a pi-hole server for all of mine. Be sure to change the resolv on your node server to use pi-hole.

Mine handles a bit over 3 million lookups a day across 100 nodes. I only blacklist anything illegal. I also block the default torrent ports for those who don’t know what they’re doing. Sadly, the Docker image uses nftables instead of iptables, so SPI filtering isn’t possible. I haven’t received any reports from my ISP in over a year.

Disable logging unless you have enough cores to justify it. But it really isn’t needed.

Edit: It wouldn’t make sense to pay for a VPN and run it through that. I assume most are using this to bypass locational limitations with streaming services or because none allow VPNs. If you run yours through a VPN, that will apply to those trying to use it. Run pi-hole, block what you can.
