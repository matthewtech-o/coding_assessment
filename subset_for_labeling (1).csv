spaghetti000s,"Steps to becoming a Radiologist:

Vet school:
x. Be within the top 1/3 of your class in Vet school (4 years)
x. Try and get published while in vet school (even just a case report is incredibly helpful)
x. Get to know your radiology department in vet school; if at all possible try to get a student worker position in the department. Ask questions, don't be annoying, read Thrall textbook as often as you can

Post Vet School:
x. Rotating internship first, choose one that has at least 2 board certified radiologists (need at least two letters of rec from them)
x. if you didn't get published in vet school, you need to do it during the rotating internship
x. Read Thrall on your downtime

Post Rotating Internship:
x. Apply for both specialty radiology imaging internships (1yr) and residencies (3-4yrs) in the same Match cycle; if you don't match to a residency first try (quite rare), hopefully you'll match to an imaging internship. Get published during this internship if you did not in the previous two steps. Read the entirety of Thrall during this internship.

x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive. It's a mix of good preparation (high GPA, good letters of rec, publications), personality (gotta get along with people for three years in residency so they won't choose an asshole no matter how brilliant you are), and connections (see step 1, getting to know the radiology department at your vet school). Above all, a healthy does of luck.


Why do all of this? Radiology is AWESOME. Most interesting specialty by far, radiologists are the hub of the hospital and get to discuss every interesting case with the top specialists in the hospital. NO owner communication - never get yelled at or make another estimate ever again. Work life balance - arguably the best you'll ever have in this field, you can work from home 100% of the time if you want to, but also amazing flexibility (can work part time from home, part in specialty hospital for example, or go do ultrasounds in local clinics one day a week). Money - you'll be nice and comfy. 

If you have the financial means and the time to put your head down and grind through the internships to get a residency... I say give it a shot.

maighdeannmhara,"We don't have a vet school enrollment or vet school shortage problem. We have retention and distribution problems. 

Rural areas lack services because working there is not desirable and sometimes not even profitable or sustainable. The work is physically demanding. On call and after hours work are required because if you're literally the only shop in town, you're responsible for providing 24/7/365 care to your patients. Anecdotally, the only people who work in rural practices and stay there long term are people who grew up there and have other ties and other reasons to be there.

What I mean by the retention problem is that many full timers end up leaving the field or dropping down to part time hours. It happens for a lot of different reasons, some related to the field and some related to wider phenomena.

None of these things - literally zero of them - can be fixed by simply opening new schools. Mark Cushing is a vulture, and everyone else is either fooling themselves or taking the opportunity to cash in, taking advantage of people who want to become vets and who will pay $55k+ per year in tuition to some slapdash rickety-ass school to get there.

Giraffefab19,"I worked night shift as an LVT for a year. Here's my advice:

1. Try to stay up as late as you can the night BEFORE you start the overnight shifts and sleep as late into the day as possible the day of your first night shift.

2. Prepare for daytime sleep: Purchase blackout curtains for your bedroom or hang a heavy blanket over your window. Buy a good sleep mask. Pick up some melatonin at the drug store and take it right before you want to go to sleep. You are trying to convince your body it is night time.

3. I am very familiar with how my body deals with caffeine so I personally did not consume any caffeine 8 hours before the end of my shift so that I would definitely sleep when I got home.

4. Do not let a single person try to convince you to do anything after your shift or before your next shift. This time is for sleeping and it is SACRED. Protect it at all costs.

5. Try to eat at regular intervals similar to what your day time food schedule is. For example, if you eat right after you wake up normally then do that for your night shift too. If you would usually eat lunch about 5 hours after breakfast, try to eat something about 5 hours after your night time ""breakfast""

christropy,"I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.

CootEnthusiast,"Anecdotal experience aside, why do you find yourself holding on to Metro? Is it because you worry about the health of the pet, or the flack from a client if you don't prescribe it or because, gasp, the diarrhea is still happening after day 2? Something else? I'll point out that you didn't really come prepared to argue your stance FOR metro in your meeting, moreso you just brought evidence to shift the spotlight onto others. Certainly Prazosin is something that should be avoided, so your evidence is not wrong, but avoiding talking about your choices doesn't necessarily help in your decision making.

I've found I rarely have a reason to prescribe it anymore, and personally had a very easy time moving away from it. Sure, those really sick AHDS dogs I hospitalized at my ER could be a reason, but the watery to soft brown diarrhea with negative giardia/fecal dogs who are otherwise well, or the known dietary indiscretion cases, definitely don't need it. Nothing about an antibiotic is going to fix a dog who ate a dead bird faster than time, and maybe some extra fiber.

It's really good you're doing self reflection like this. You're not a dinosaur, you're just trying your best to find reasoning for how to make your medical decisions.

christropy,"I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.

Otterwut,"I think your position is not an uncommon one. I've seen it many times in real life and seen it on this subreddit even more. I've been working in vet med for 15 years and have worked every position in the hospital at some point. I currently offer my relief services to 5 hospitals and have worked at nearly 20 in my time ranging from small single doctor GP clinics to university ECC. All this to say that, in my experience, this happens to even boarded specialists at any and all levels.

 I've worked with brilliant technicians who I would trust over some doctors and whose advice is absolutely golden. If you have one of those in your clinic then be a sponge and learn all you can from them. Their experience is invaluable and a good tech is a life and license saver. You will make mistakes and they will help you catch them. 

Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the techs/assistants you're working with will not be these people. A large amount of the work force for nurses are on the job trained and have only worked at maybe 1-2 hospitals for a few years. They don't know what they don't know, and I can say this because I went through that gauntlet myself. The more I've learned the quicker I am to pause and think about why someone may have done something they did. There's a good chance the people giving you trouble are the ones who fall in this category. It boils my blood to see how pervasive it is to have nurses who don't even understand why decisions are being made criticize doctors for them. There are multiple boarded specialists I've seen get shit on by nurses who when pressed for more details about exactly what they did wrong could either only provide wrong information, are lacking SIGNIFICANT context clues or base knowledge to even understand what they're judging, or just don't have anything worth while and just like the drama. The people who lack this knowledge are the quickest to judge and those who know the most tend to be more patient and understanding. This has been true for pretty much every single one of my 18 clinics I've worked at. 

My best advice is to see where this advice is coming from. If it's from a trusted source who means well then absolutely forget your ego and absorb anything you can. If it's from the clinic drama queen with the over inflated ego then just ignore it and move on.

laserxop,"Speaking from a government vet perspective. 

Not only did I go through a similar thing (not feeling like I was cut out to do clinical work), I actually had a greater interest in Veterinary public health and pathology. You said it's mostly an ""office job"". Federal? State? Or are you outside the US? 
I, myself, took the official veterinarian route. 
I actually started off working for the government of NZ where not only did I carry out verification of sanitary procedures, was also in charge of handling animal welfare issues and conducted compliance visits at a number of farms. 
The work life balance was pretty sweet indeed. 
I did end up moving ""into an office"" eventually where I was dealing with animal imports and animal import products. It was mostly policy but, again, offered further work life balance. 

Fast forward to 2022 and I am State side working for the USDA as a Public Health Veterinarian. If this is the govt job you are talking about, it is certainly not an office job... haha. I guess it does depend on the location but I would say it does put your knowledge to test. Particularly pathology. 
I'm no longer in that role and, yeah, now I'm in a role that's a bit more removed from Veterinary medicine. One that still involves a lot of technical skills and whole lot of soft skills. Still, I view my current role as a stepping stone. There are definitely roles that do require clinical knowledge through APHIS as well. 

Not sure if you were one of those that dreamed of working in a veterinary clinic. That wasn't quite me. So I at least wanted to share some perspective on the government vet role. It may not be your thing, but there are definitely a lot of opportunities through government vet roles.

Giraffefab19,"I worked night shift as an LVT for a year. Here's my advice:

1. Try to stay up as late as you can the night BEFORE you start the overnight shifts and sleep as late into the day as possible the day of your first night shift.

2. Prepare for daytime sleep: Purchase blackout curtains for your bedroom or hang a heavy blanket over your window. Buy a good sleep mask. Pick up some melatonin at the drug store and take it right before you want to go to sleep. You are trying to convince your body it is night time.

3. I am very familiar with how my body deals with caffeine so I personally did not consume any caffeine 8 hours before the end of my shift so that I would definitely sleep when I got home.

4. Do not let a single person try to convince you to do anything after your shift or before your next shift. This time is for sleeping and it is SACRED. Protect it at all costs.

5. Try to eat at regular intervals similar to what your day time food schedule is. For example, if you eat right after you wake up normally then do that for your night shift too. If you would usually eat lunch about 5 hours after breakfast, try to eat something about 5 hours after your night time ""breakfast""

calliopeReddit,"> I won‚Äôt be able to unless I become at least a tech or a veterinarian

Don't think of veterinary technicians like that - the job of technicians is valuable, but it's also very different from that of a vet.  It's not ""lesser"", so there's no ""at least"" about it.  The first thing you should do is spend some time in a clinic (or several clinics, if you can) so you can see what the jobs of vets and techs are.   Don't even think about schooling until you know for sure it's what you want to do.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,i won‚Äôt be able to unless i become at least a tech or a veterinarian dont think of veterinary technicians like that the job of technicians is valuable but its also very different from that of a vet its not lesser so theres no at least about it the first thing you should do is spend some time in a clinic or several clinics if you can so you can see what the jobs of vets and techs are dont even think about schooling until you know for sure its what you want to do
V3DRER,"Cornerstone is certainly not complicated to write EMRs in, but there is also a very minimal automation. The medical record system is basically a simple word processor. The clinic can set up whatever pre-populated template works best for them. Actually the clinic can make as many templates as they want, for example customized to different types of visits (i.e. vaccine appointment versus sick patient exam) or a different templates for each doctor. No idea why anyone would have cornerstone and not use the EMR part. What do they do with cornerstone?

Varishta,"I didn‚Äôt find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn‚Äôt study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they‚Äôre used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you‚Äôll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge.

greyhoundknight,"Look up spay neuter techniques on the ASPCA Pro site. I've been in shelter medicine for 5 years now and having hosted vet students (and experienced vets) I am confidently say that spay surgeries are taught incorrectly.

Incision placement is super important and the ASPCA Pro site has some videos on it. Typing it out sucks but I can if you'd like. With cats, I would either break/cut the ligament to do autoligation OR I would suture ligate with the ligament intact. Another tip for for cats and dogs is to always single ligate the broad ligament unless it is super clear. They won't bleed out from those vessels but they can bleed enough to trick you into thinking something important is bleeding.

maighdeannmhara,"I think we're more likely to ignore studies that go against our personal experiences, and with metronidazole, it's such a commonly used medication that we all have a lot of experience with it. And we all seem to think it really works. As a GP, I've only seen a handful of blocked cats over 3 years, so I don't have any strong feelings or preferences with prazosin or any other aspects of management. So it's easy to change what I do based on new studies. But I see multiple cases of diarrhea just about every week of the year, so it's really easy to build up anecdata and blind spots.

I try to avoid metro for the most part. I've had good results with fiber supplementation and have gone that route with my own dogs with success. There are some cases where I reach for metro or tylosin if bland diet + fiber + probiotics fails. I also have a handful of clients who are used to getting it every time, so I cave in. And I have one worked up through internal med who is on it chronically. But overall, the evidence for antibiotics causing dysbiosis and predisposing to long term problems is very compelling, and it's all over the human lit as well. So I'm convinced overall.

I'm also wondering about all of these various doodle breeds who seem predisposed to chronic enteropathy. I've had a few who got metro as puppies and have had non-stop issues since. Of course it's impossible to tell if their issues were exacerbated by metro or if they were already going to have exactly the same problems and that's *why* they got metro so early in life in the first place. Still, I really, really try to avoid metro and tylosin in dogs who haven't reached full maturity.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,i think were more likely to ignore studies that go against our personal experiences and with metronidazole its such a commonly used medication that we all have a lot of experience with it and we all seem to think it really works as a gp ive only seen a handful of blocked cats over years so i dont have any strong feelings or preferences with prazosin or any other aspects of management so its easy to change what i do based on new studies but i see multiple cases of diarrhea just about every week of the year so its really easy to build up anecdata and blind spots i try to avoid metro for the most part ive had good results with fiber supplementation and have gone that route with my own dogs with success there are some cases where i reach for metro or tylosin if bland diet fiber probiotics fails i also have a handful of clients who are used to getting it every time so i cave in and i have one worked up through internal med who is on it chronically but overall the evidence for antibiotics causing dysbiosis and predisposing to long term problems is very compelling and its all over the human lit as well so im convinced overall im also wondering about all of these various doodle breeds who seem predisposed to chronic enteropathy ive had a few who got metro as puppies and have had nonstop issues since of course its impossible to tell if their issues were exacerbated by metro or if they were already going to have exactly the same problems and thats why they got metro so early in life in the first place still i really really try to avoid metro and tylosin in dogs who havent reached full maturity

Basically if it was something that you know you have to do SOME config to selfhost, like a nginx+certbot reverseproxy&certification setup, it's assumed that you're gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from, and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind.

But Mysterium presents itself as a set&forget for both node and client, and competing in the same space as centralized VPNs... not exactly the same ""targets"" obviously, the more curious-tinkerer ones, but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users.

And I mean 'end-users', little to no skill/knowledge requirement announced.

And thus, the Node runner guide is roughly the same length as the DVPN user guide, in appearance thus ""as simple and straightforward"".

That's how it's 'marketed', by the Mysterium team as well as every content creator I saw talking about it.

Encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui, no further configuration, or else to do it on a spare computer, spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian, install myst, jump to webui, no further configuration.

The section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and NAT is solely about troubleshooting an offline node... aka, tell you to punch holes, but not really anything about plugging up holes.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say ""Mysterium bad"", because it's indeed the node runner's responsibility to secure their network, and to not install shit on it they can't control.

But share fault, because you wouldn't advertise a sport car as a ""beginner friendly"" car to a new driver on probation license, and *omit* to tell them it's delivered with ABS toggled off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvh8m4r/ ",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,mhm basically if it was something that you know you have to do some config to selfhost like a nginxcertbot reverseproxycertification setup its assumed that youre gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind but mysterium presents itself as a setforget for both node and client and competing in the same space as centralized vpns not exactly the same targets obviously the more curioustinkerer ones but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users and i mean endusers little to no skillknowledge requirement announced and thus the node runner guide is roughly the same length as the dvpn user guide in appearance thus as simple and straightforward thats how its marketed by the mysterium team as well as every content creator i saw talking about it encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui no further configuration or else to do it on a spare computer spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian install myst jump to webui no further configuration the section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and nat is solely about troubleshooting an offline node aka tell you to punch holes but not really anything about plugging up holes i wouldnt say mysterium bad because its indeed the node runners responsibility to secure their network and to not install shit on it they cant control but share fault because you wouldnt advertise a sport car as a beginner friendly car to a new driver on probation license and omit to tell them its delivered with abs toggled off

DanLikesColdBeer,"In terms of customization, SOAP and procedure templates are most important to me. I personally like that I can have a template for a general physical exam, a neuro exam, a cardio exam, etc. I can have a template for surgeries, so it is preset in regards to what meds I'll use and prices set based on size of pet. However, I'm an associate vet, so I'm not sure at this point what options would be most important for management/owners.

Switching from paper records to cloud-based is a LOT of work, because we have to scan the paper records and attach them to the corresponding digital record. Even for a small practice, that's thousands of records. If a practice is already out of the stone age, switching from one software to another would still be quite the hassle. It took months just to get our vaccination reminders to properly transfer from the old software to the new. There was a lot of lost time and things slipping through the cracks as all of the staff get accustomed to the new software.

As for learning curves with new software, I think that part of it is how intuitive it is. But a bigger part is probably that most of the staff in a vet clinic aren't all that tech savvy. I don't think that's specific to my workplace. A lot of people tend to just throw their hands up and admit defeat, saying they aren't good with computers. I can show somehow how to fix an issue and they will understand and be able to repeat that process themselves.

kiraitachi," I agree with you. Not only that, it also is a great stable coin to invest when Bear market.

Recently it was at 30 cents. Being able to buy Mysterium now at 16 cents and stake/hold waiting for 30 cents value to come back is a great investment. You can safely say that when back to 30 cents you will double your gains in an almost stable coin. 

At least thats my feeling. Not as boring as a stable coin, not as risky as any other crypto.

Would also add that the community is growing and fresh, giving you a great chance to participate and be involved deeply with the team and community. I was able to be ambassador, develop a portable client for Mysterium and support on github issues. This is a project with real utility and achievement in their goals.

boomerius,"First and most obvious answer is VPN. As all code will be open sourced thus anyone could take Mysterion code as an example, remake it as they wish, putting their logo, translate app into any language, use their payment methods and launch it as a separate VPN service, without ever needing to deploy a single VPN node, just using Mysterium API. Once we see this happening we will need to allocate certain amount of focus on improving this aspect of the service to match market needs for it. 

Once there we will progress to other use cases (in the beginning we will use OpenVPN as our main transport protocol which is somewhat limiting) so we will be learning left and right about potential other use cases and what technology is needed which might empower them (be it other transport protocols or something entirely different). 

Ultimately I believe we could see services built for crunching data, also Apps and dApps using Mysterium as their secure communication channel between any 2 end points whenever they need one - for example to create a secure communication channel between a user and a server, or a user to another user, or a user and a device. This could be applied to any number of services which need a secure communication channel. For example it could be: payment apps like Paypal, Revolut or any of the wallet apps, communication apps like Snapchat or Whatsapp, e-commerce services such as Shoppify, then content delivery services such as Netflix trying to ensure their users can access content when traveling abroad, etc..

If anybody would ask - I would be betting on a larger community to come up with use cases which we never even dreamt of.

ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that‚Äôs the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It‚Äôs far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it‚Äôs not something they‚Äôre super familiar with, but is something I‚Äôve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I‚Äôm losing one of my new grads and I‚Äôm super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn‚Äôt have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you‚Äôre not comfortable taking the lead, if you‚Äôre not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you‚Äôre comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don‚Äôt go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example‚Ä¶ you most likely will get yelled at lol).

martakuz,"I‚Äôll give you an answer from my personal point of view. 

During the next quarter we plan to expand our team with senior marketing, accounting, legal professionals, and this is very important (thus exciting) for us in the long run. We are also ready to start collaborating with developers working remotely, - that will bring us a fresh perspective on all we do and increase our chances to find the top talent we need four our ambitious plans.

We continue working on our organisational structure and values - another thing that will have a huge impact on the team in the future. 

I am also excited to see the pre-alpha (Mysterion as we call it) being used by wider audiences. 

What is my biggest disappointment? I believe we could have had more people in the team by now if we (or myself) really focused on that. Delisting on Bittrex was a big distraction for me personally.

Desperate-Car6229,"Definitely understand that! I think from what I‚Äôve heard there are many different sides to the education for clinical year. I‚Äôve heard stories from students at places with teaching hospitals who describe their clinical year as being treated as a glorified tech for free labor getting to do barely any procedures because of competition with interns and residents. 

On the other hand, I‚Äôve talked to students from my school who during their clinical year have wracked up hundreds of surgeries under their belt, from spays and neuters to dentals, amputations, enunciations, etc‚Ä¶ and basically running appointments by themselves, but I‚Äôve also heard students who said they went to rotations where they didn‚Äôt get to do much or saw some not as good standard medicine. I think that the variability is probably much crazier and depends on how you plan your clinical year and what site you go to.

So I definitely see the concern and I think both have pros and cons to them!

And it seems like looking at tuition then it‚Äôs pretty comparable. I was accepted to Cornell OOS and chose to go to U of A as a resident and when I compared costs it was over 100k more.

Some of the most successful and wonderful Veterinarians I have worked with have had at least some degree of difficulty at the start. Part of being a great veterinarian is recognizing where you might focus your learning and knowing that you will continue to develop your skills for your entire career.

Regarding feedback, being a good veterinarian doesn't necessarily translate to being a great teacher or mentor, those skills are a completely different developmental piece that not everyone has. I hope that you can find a person or people to help you develop both skills and confidence along the way.

soderstrom_ansa,"I will say i have the same concerns as you, even though I am not in the exact same position. 

I was 21 years old when I entered the vet school. It might not be as bad, but I realized it took us 11 semesters or 5 1/2 years to get the DVM degree  in Indonesia. So I will be at least 26 or 27 when i graduated.

The concerns I had is with how job availability works in Indonesia. This country has a very, very discriminative job requirements regarding the age, and there's no law protecting the citizens from it. Most of the companies here only hire people BELOW 25, while at the same time most of them require the applicants to have an experience in the field at last a year or two. So the anxiety just ramped up when I realized that. I have no experience and I will be older than 25 when I graduate.

But I think being a vet is more than a job, more than an errand to do to get money. I decided to be a vet in a very recent time before I get to the school, yet I already love being a vet student in my 6th semester now. I don't think I wanna be or can be anything other than a vet. If there's no way for me to work in my country, I can just work at another (I guess).

So, I think there's no harm for you to just go and achieve your dream as a vet, especially when age is not a big deal there. I think you'll do just fine being a vet student while also living your adult life.

sfchin98,"You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \*\*guided\*\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \*think\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.

To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of ""normal"" and it overlaps with a lot of ""abnormal."" And what I mean by normal is ""no clinically significant abnormalities"", which is different from ""textbook normal."" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis ‚Äî fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. ‚Äî and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude ""normal abdomen."" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \*\*in\*\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \*\*out\*\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. ""Normal abdomen"" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). 

So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.

For websites, [https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/) is a good repository of cases. It's run by Allison Zwingenberger at UC Davis, she is generally one of the more highly regarded academic radiologists out there. 

This is also a great online atlas: [https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy](https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy) although it's mainly for CT/MRI. There is one section for dog MSK rads, which I think is still useful. This is BY FAR my most used reference in day to day work, but I don't know how useful it is to a non-radiologist. It is $95/year as a subscription, but the dog MSK rads (and also the dog CT head) atlases are free.

This is an online lecture on thoracic imaging by Tony Pease, also a very highly regarded (formerly academic) radiologist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwpzKmqsruM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwpzkmqsrum)

I admit I have not watched that lecture, but I implicitly trust anything that Tony Pease has to say about radiology. 

And I think in terms of day-to-day practice, the best thing you can do is send out as many cases as you can for teleradiology readouts, and just test out your interpretation against the radiologist's. Hopefully there's a telerad service your clinic uses and trusts, and any time you're at all unsure about your rads just offer the telerad readout to the pet owner.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,you probably wont like this answer but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance theres the adage of needing hours of practice to become an expert at something but whats usually lost from that concept is that its hours of guided practice that is being supervised by a teacher trainer coach etc to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes without the guidance you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits i have met many gps and er vets with years of experience who think they are good at rads but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation to take it a step further even radiologists who are working solo andor teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest we may as well believe we have a accuracy rate to me the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal this is a lot harder than it sounds because there is a very wide range of normal and it overlaps with a lot of abnormal and what i mean by normal is no clinically significant abnormalities which is different from textbook normal a prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea most of the time i read these out as normal abdomen the intern or er doc may then come and ask so these dont look like gastroenteritis to which i ask what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis and they dont answer because of course there arent really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis i may see some things that i associate more often with gastroenteritis ‚Äî fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum diffuse gas dilation of the gi tract etc ‚Äî and if the clinical history fits i may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup but in reality those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no gi symptoms at all so it wouldnt be wrong to just conclude normal abdomen the goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule in gastroenteritis it is to rule out mechanical obstruction radiopaque foreign material or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites normal abdomen effectively rules those things out leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits ie not in acute renal failure liver failure addisonian crisis etc so ultimately this is where reading textbooks like thrall is useful even if the example images arent amazing you learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes there isnt really a better overall textbook out there than thrall for thorax specifically though i like the bsava manual of canine and feline thoracic imaging its a little bit dated published but its not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then the bsava abdomen and msk books are decent but not as good as the thorax one for websites httpswwwveterinaryradiologynet is a good repository of cases its run by allison zwingenberger at uc davis she is generally one of the more highly regarded academic radiologists out there this is also a great online atlas httpswwwimaioscomenvetanatomy although its mainly for ctmri there is one section for dog msk rads which i think is still useful this is by far my most used reference in day to day work but i dont know how useful it is to a nonradiologist it is as a subscription but the dog msk rads and also the dog ct head atlases are free this is an online lecture on thoracic imaging by tony pease also a very highly regarded formerly academic radiologist httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkwpzkmqsrum i admit i have not watched that lecture but i implicitly trust anything that tony pease has to say about radiology and i think in terms of daytoday practice the best thing you can do is send out as many cases as you can for teleradiology readouts and just test out your interpretation against the radiologists hopefully theres a telerad service your clinic uses and trusts and any time youre at all unsure about your rads just offer the telerad readout to the pet owner

nctr,"Hi, thank you very much for all you are doing for Mysterium VPN!

&#x200B;

Several questions:

\- any upcoming partnerships with other VPNs to sell them bandwidth? 

\- Is currently the number of nodes or the numbers of bandwidth users (internal or from external partners?) the bottleneck? What are you doing to make it less of a bottleneck?

\- There used to be a partnership with the Sentinel DVPN, as in allow users to use each others nodes. Is this still planned?

\- Any plan for whitelabel VPNs? As in I create my own website, design and possibly GUI for my VPN company, but pay mysterium in the backend to be able to use their servers? Possibly with a generic GUI that can simply be rebranded to my own brand.

pwny__express,"Yeah this is an issue everywhere I've worked. Even if the majority of rDVMs do everything they're asked to, the handful that don't, really stand out. 

Sorry in advance, this meme triggered me, so vent following: 

It represents a more general breakdown of the old-school dynamic between ECC DVMs and rDVMs (in my view); COVID and post-COVID changes in our profession further strained this relationship.

The established dogma essentially works like this: rDVM referral => speciality emergency care => return to rDVM for follow-up ; always with the inherent and assumed professional collegiality (ie. communication) necessary to ensure the patient is receiving the appropriate care - before, during, and after a visit to emergency & critical care. This (in theory) allows for continuity of care and a cyclic, self-referring economic practice that preserves the rDVM-client relationship and preserves the rDVM-ECC DVM relationship.

This is how it should work in practice, but the realities of veterinary medicine in the last 4-5 years has shown erosion of the conventions and practical applications of this system. This system really only works for our patients when everyone (rDVM, ECC DVM) is equally invested in the pet's outcome. For example: 

- if an rDVM evaluates a sick patient and then transfers with no call, no records, and no conversation with an owner - they're essentially both delegating their job to me, and simultaneously making my job harder. In 2 years I've had 10-12 cases where owners arrive clueless to how sick their pet is and clueless to the costs for 2 or 3 days of ICU care, and they've ultimately elected for humane euthanasia after a 5-10 minute conversation. The rDVM also charged the owner a consultation fee, which seems like it should've covered that same conversation. 
- location dependent, but where I am, rDVMs are rarely available for the follow-up necessary to recheck *their own patients*. Discharging a patient from the ICU means they are well enough to go home, not necessarily that they're healthy. Most of these patients need a follow-up within 7-10 days (if not sooner) and rDVMs often seem to struggle getting appointments within 3-4 weeks. Patients requiring open-wound management are a great example - they require bandage changes every 1-3 days, often times for weeks at a time. Emergency & critical care can happily put these animals back together on day 1. But ECC, by definition, doesn't see appointments, we are not meant to be there for the scheduled follow-up care, and it's inappropriate to presume that we are now the animals' primary doctor. Of course, we're often the only choice, so my days commonly involve seeing all the new patients coming in off the street, all the patients being transferred from the rDVM, and sprinkling in the 'recheck appointments' that our patients need. rDVMs should have a very clear understanding of how difficult it is to arrange an appointment in the middle of a schedule that is by default, unpredictable. Is this not the same problem facing our counterparts in human medicine that are overwhelmed with people relying on the ER as their primary care? 

Recognizing a minority of bad apples don't represent the majority of rDVMs - if the perception is rDVMs are not fulfilling their role prior to transfer and after discharge, it makes it really hard to want to play along and coddle the precious rDVM-client relationship, much less maintain any collegial rDVM-ECC DVM relationship. 

- it sometimes feels as if the primary motivation for the rDVM not the outcome for the patient, but rather preserving a VCPR with the client (ie. preserving opportunity for income). Because I actually don't care if the client returns to the rDVM; my motivation is for the best outcome for my patient
- what reason do I have to go out of my way to maintain collegial rDVM relationships, when this is how ECC is treated? I mean, I do anyway, but I'm salty about it. There is no longer an economic motivation to maintain these relationships; in many areas one ECC clinic is the *only choice* - so I'm going to see the ECC patients whether I want to or not, and rDVMs are going to continue referring sick animals to ECC, because they don't have a choice. Alternatively, I welcome rDVMs to feel free to begin treating and working these patients up on their own.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,yeah this is an issue everywhere ive worked even if the majority of rdvms do everything theyre asked to the handful that dont really stand out sorry in advance this meme triggered me so vent following it represents a more general breakdown of the oldschool dynamic between ecc dvms and rdvms in my view covid and postcovid changes in our profession further strained this relationship the established dogma essentially works like this rdvm referral speciality emergency care return to rdvm for followup always with the inherent and assumed professional collegiality ie communication necessary to ensure the patient is receiving the appropriate care before during and after a visit to emergency critical care this in theory allows for continuity of care and a cyclic selfreferring economic practice that preserves the rdvmclient relationship and preserves the rdvmecc dvm relationship this is how it should work in practice but the realities of veterinary medicine in the last years has shown erosion of the conventions and practical applications of this system this system really only works for our patients when everyone rdvm ecc dvm is equally invested in the pets outcome for example if an rdvm evaluates a sick patient and then transfers with no call no records and no conversation with an owner theyre essentially both delegating their job to me and simultaneously making my job harder in years ive had cases where owners arrive clueless to how sick their pet is and clueless to the costs for or days of icu care and theyve ultimately elected for humane euthanasia after a minute conversation the rdvm also charged the owner a consultation fee which seems like it shouldve covered that same conversation location dependent but where i am rdvms are rarely available for the followup necessary to recheck their own patients discharging a patient from the icu means they are well enough to go home not necessarily that theyre healthy most of these patients need a followup within days if not sooner and rdvms often seem to struggle getting appointments within weeks patients requiring openwound management are a great example they require bandage changes every days often times for weeks at a time emergency critical care can happily put these animals back together on day but ecc by definition doesnt see appointments we are not meant to be there for the scheduled followup care and its inappropriate to presume that we are now the animals primary doctor of course were often the only choice so my days commonly involve seeing all the new patients coming in off the street all the patients being transferred from the rdvm and sprinkling in the recheck appointments that our patients need rdvms should have a very clear understanding of how difficult it is to arrange an appointment in the middle of a schedule that is by default unpredictable is this not the same problem facing our counterparts in human medicine that are overwhelmed with people relying on the er as their primary care recognizing a minority of bad apples dont represent the majority of rdvms if the perception is rdvms are not fulfilling their role prior to transfer and after discharge it makes it really hard to want to play along and coddle the precious rdvmclient relationship much less maintain any collegial rdvmecc dvm relationship it sometimes feels as if the primary motivation for the rdvm not the outcome for the patient but rather preserving a vcpr with the client ie preserving opportunity for income because i actually dont care if the client returns to the rdvm my motivation is for the best outcome for my patient what reason do i have to go out of my way to maintain collegial rdvm relationships when this is how ecc is treated i mean i do anyway but im salty about it there is no longer an economic motivation to maintain these relationships in many areas one ecc clinic is the only choice so im going to see the ecc patients whether i want to or not and rdvms are going to continue referring sick animals to ecc because they dont have a choice alternatively i welcome rdvms to feel free to begin treating and working these patients up on their own

dvmdude,"It happens to everyone. One thing I did early on was tie my knots too close to the clamp. Clamps can spread the pedicle quite wide, so if you tie too close to it the ligature might initially be tight but the pedicle shrinks once you remove the clamp and the ligature slips. Try shimmying the knot down a little bit or making sure you have a good crush to tie.

I am a double-ligater too, and I tend to do my first knot further down the pedicle (sometimes without clamping depending on fat) and tighten it down but don't crank it if I am worried about it tearing. Then when I do my second knot closer to the ovary, I really crank that one. That way if you tighten too hard on knot #2 and tear the pedicle you've got the first one as backup, and if it holds you know you've got good security.

Echoing suture size, and I do a strangle or Millers knot. There is a lot of confusion about Millers, Modified-Millers, so just double check which one you are using. A true Modified-Millers has poorer security.

sfchin98,"There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point. There may be internal data within the cardiology college (ACVIM) but I am not privy to it if so. 

Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.

Academia is a totally different ballgame, and most likely the average academic cardiologist makes $100-150K, basically the same as a private practice GP. You'll make more as you move up the ladder towards full professor/tenure, but that is quite a slog. Basically, the only reasons to work in academia would be:

1. You have zero to minimal loans and don't care about making money.
2. You are a foreign vet without ECFVG/PAVE/NAVLE certification and have to work under an umbrella license.
3. You love teaching and research so much that you are willing to live the rest of your life in debt for it.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,there are no reliable data that im aware of and salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic so any data you find from or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point there may be internal data within the cardiology college acvim but i am not privy to it if so generally speaking cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services as a basic rule of thumb simply by being in a major clinical specialty you probably will be making at bare minimum i would guess the average cardiologist makes around and i personally know cardiologists making over which is probably midupper range for private practice i would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making this is all wild speculation though academia is a totally different ballgame and most likely the average academic cardiologist makes basically the same as a private practice gp youll make more as you move up the ladder towards full professortenure but that is quite a slog basically the only reasons to work in academia would be you have zero to minimal loans and dont care about making money you are a foreign vet without ecfvgpavenavle certification and have to work under an umbrella license you love teaching and research so much that you are willing to live the rest of your life in debt for it
calliopeReddit,"Yes, relief work is a good way to travel as a vet, but you would need a license in every jurisdiction where you would practice.   That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

Honest_Tomatillo013,"So this totally sounds like a corporate veterinary Clinic because I don‚Äôt know anywhere else where a technician would have the audacity to speak to another vet like that in a private practice. I‚Äôve been working in veterinary medicine for over 20 years and just recently graduated with my degree to take the VTNE next month and with even all my great experience, I do not know more than a doctor Nor do I have the skills of a doctor!

Varishta,"I didn‚Äôt find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn‚Äôt study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they‚Äôre used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you‚Äôll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge.

The-vorpal-blade,"Yep.  The mentor program is one of the big ways they want to differentiate themselves.  I mentored a new grad over the past year and it went really well.  When hiring a new grad we picked someone that was going to be in charge of their mentorship (me).  I then went to MVPs mentor training course which was really helpful in talking about training and communication styles, managing goals and expectations etc.  MVP gave us time once a week (had us block off appointments) so that we could meet outside the hospital and discuss how things were going, talk about cases, goals, any changes we wanted to make and give feedback to each other on how things were going.  I had oversight and guidance from vets at the home office and my mentee sent them reviews on how I was doing as a mentor.  

We also had a pretty structured way on how we started her off with appointments to give time for mentoring and learning and didn't start increasing appointment numbers until she was ready to take in more.

BytesHQ,"**Hey guys! Savannah here (@BytesHQ), Brand Director at Mysterium.**

**Thanks for all your great questions. I'll kick things off with answering this one, since it's specifically my domain...**

Before mainnet, our marketing was heavily geared towards acquiring VPN users and nodes. It was really effective and our growth took us by complete surprise - annually we had 487% in network traffic, 611% increase in monthly active users and 773% increase in nodes!Post-mainnet, we‚Äôre switching things up and thinking bigger. 

&#x200B;

Our strategy is to grow the brand awareness of the protocol itself, attracting developers and projects to expand the Mysterium ecosystem. We will be incentivising teams and entrepreneurs to build censorship-resistant products and services on the network.

&#x200B;

This also means a strong focus on new strategic partnerships, with global hackathons, incubators, dWeb projects, internet organisations, and marketing partners. We will have a number of integration partnerships announced in the following months, including new L1 and L2 blockchain ecosystems.

&#x200B;

Our next partnership announcement is with Community Gaming - a platform for E-sports tournaments. We see a lot of value in connecting with the global gaming community, who are often the first to pioneer new technologies and drive innovation in the tech sector generally. Our gaming tournament will go live this Friday, 27th of November, and last for 4 weeks.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,hey guys savannah here byteshq brand director at mysterium thanks for all your great questions ill kick things off with answering this one since its specifically my domain before mainnet our marketing was heavily geared towards acquiring vpn users and nodes it was really effective and our growth took us by complete surprise annually we had in network traffic increase in monthly active users and increase in nodespostmainnet we‚Äôre switching things up and thinking bigger our strategy is to grow the brand awareness of the protocol itself attracting developers and projects to expand the mysterium ecosystem we will be incentivising teams and entrepreneurs to build censorshipresistant products and services on the network this also means a strong focus on new strategic partnerships with global hackathons incubators dweb projects internet organisations and marketing partners we will have a number of integration partnerships announced in the following months including new and blockchain ecosystems our next partnership announcement is with community gaming a platform for esports tournaments we see a lot of value in connecting with the global gaming community who are often the first to pioneer new technologies and drive innovation in the tech sector generally our gaming tournament will go live this friday of november and last for weeks

chompomonim,"I'd like clarify a little timeline behind tokenomics 2.0 and node staking.   
Tokenomics 2.0 staking (when node have to stake own or borrowed MYST to receive traffic) will be introduced only in end of Q1 2022. All current calculations of 1 MYST stake to receive $0.01 DAI is just preview of what is comming rather than something node runners will need to do right after mainnet launch.  
In upcoming Mainnet release, new nodes will have to stake some small amount of MYST (between 0.1MYST and 10MYST) to proof skin in the game and cover registration tx fee (pay for Polygon gas). This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.  


**Tokenomics 1.0 staking:**

* proofs that node is puting skin in the game and is not just random bot sending proposals
* will guarantee that hermes is always ready to settle (important for those who'd like to do very rare settlements and withdrawals --> saving blockchain tx fees) 
* will increase node's changes being higher in smart (re)connect selection --> more likely to get sessions

MYST_team,"Mysterium VPN has a unique edge over regular VPNs like Nord and Cyberghost. We give you exclusive access to the largest network of genuine residential IP addresses, just like the ones you have on your mobile and at home.   
So you get reliable connections that appear like real-world users. This is very helpful when you are travelling and need to access certain websites and apps that might be blocked in different countries. Using a residential VPN means you can easily access your messaging apps, social media, subscription accounts, shows and sports matches no matter where you are in the world.  
  
For context - your average VPN service typically connects you to centralized data centre servers, which often have built-in third-party trackers and shady logging practices. They‚Äôre also routinely flagged by popular streaming services, as they are easily identified as data centre commercial IPs. Residential IPs are far more stable, high-quality connections that are harder to detect and block.   
  
On top of that, we support nodes in more than 135 countries, a number that‚Äôs higher than almost any competitor in the market and we‚Äôre working to improve this even further.   
  
Lastly, one of our key focuses in our new applications is simplicity. We want to get you connected as soon as possible, without worrying about any details :)

Aniilin,"Hello everyone!  
  
I've been using Kryptex for a while now, and I've got a good grasp of mining.   
However, I have some questions about Mysterium.  
  
How can I assess or calculate my monthly profit with Mysterium?   
I've gone through the articles provided by Kryptex, but the profitability of Mysterium remains unclear to me. How is profitability calculated? And how can I boost my earnings without switching to Mysterium Dark?  
  
It appears that Mysterium Dark (Public) is not recommended, as it might not be safe for me as a Node keeper. I've gone through the terms, but they are not entirely clear. Perhaps, this is a question for the Mysterium Team.

MikeBowden," Yes, you can do this. I run a pi-hole server for all of mine. Be sure to change the resolv on your node server to use pi-hole.

Mine handles a bit over 3 million lookups a day across 100 nodes. I only blacklist anything illegal. I also block the default torrent ports for those who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing. Sadly, the Docker image uses nftables instead of iptables, so SPI filtering isn‚Äôt possible. I haven‚Äôt received any reports from my ISP in over a year.

Disable logging unless you have enough cores to justify it. But it really isn‚Äôt needed.

Edit: It wouldn‚Äôt make sense to pay for a VPN and run it through that. I assume most are using this to bypass locational limitations with streaming services or because none allow VPNs. If you run yours through a VPN, that will apply to those trying to use it. Run pi-hole, block what you can.

Flaky_Owl_,"I forgot a fair amount of what I learnt in my first couple years of vet school by the time I was graduating honestly (5 year undergraduate degree, I still passed the NAVLE on the first attempt). It's why I'm spending a lot of time having now graduated relearning a lot of fundamental physiology and medicine by sitting down and properly studying these texts. 

Oftentimes I was just remembering enough key information from a power point slide to pass an exam. Now I am sitting down and reading, as an example, Nunn and Lumb's Applied Respiratory Physiology from front to back.

Perhaps I'm a particularly bad example of this but I feel that myself and many of my colleagues did not graduate with a meaningful understanding of what I would now describe as key concepts. As an example, I left vet school not really understanding the renin‚Äìangiotensin-aldosterone system pathways properly. Sure I could draw it out and name what was going on, but I didn't really understand it. It's only now that I've graduated that I could properly sit down and read Vander's that I've developed a better understanding of it.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that the curriculum in many vet schools is pretty lacklustre and the sheer volume of information you have to learn can result in a lack of meaningful understanding of many key concepts, resulting in them having to be learnt years after having graduated. This isn't to say that a graduate veterinarian is incompetent or stupid, just that a lot of learning will happen once they graduate.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,i forgot a fair amount of what i learnt in my first couple years of vet school by the time i was graduating honestly year undergraduate degree i still passed the navle on the first attempt its why im spending a lot of time having now graduated relearning a lot of fundamental physiology and medicine by sitting down and properly studying these texts oftentimes i was just remembering enough key information from a power point slide to pass an exam now i am sitting down and reading as an example nunn and lumbs applied respiratory physiology from front to back perhaps im a particularly bad example of this but i feel that myself and many of my colleagues did not graduate with a meaningful understanding of what i would now describe as key concepts as an example i left vet school not really understanding the renin‚Äìangiotensinaldosterone system pathways properly sure i could draw it out and name what was going on but i didnt really understand it its only now that ive graduated that i could properly sit down and read vanders that ive developed a better understanding of it basically what im trying to say is that the curriculum in many vet schools is pretty lacklustre and the sheer volume of information you have to learn can result in a lack of meaningful understanding of many key concepts resulting in them having to be learnt years after having graduated this isnt to say that a graduate veterinarian is incompetent or stupid just that a lot of learning will happen once they graduate

sfchin98,"That is sort of ""in between"". The WBS has one full time staff veterinarian. She is not a board-certified specialist, but has a lot of wildlife/avian related experience including an internship at a wildlife center. I would guess she consults with various specialists on individual cases depending on the need (e.g., surgery, ophthalmology, radiology). 

I would suspect most bird sanctuaries are not well enough funded to have a veterinarian on staff, so they probably have relationships with local avian/exotics vets who would likely be non-boarded or else ABVP (Avian) boarded who spend most of their time with pet birds but consult with the sanctuary as needed. If there is a close enough vet school with a zoo/exotics/wildlife department that would also be a common route. 

Basically, making a career out of mostly or exclusively working with native wild birds in a sanctuary/rehab environment is an extremely niche (and likely very low-paying) path. Most who end up in that situation probably spent a lot of time carving out a custom path to it, with a decent amount of luck along the way, as opposed to following some well-established path hitting standard goalposts/benchmarks.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,that is sort of in between the wbs has one full time staff veterinarian she is not a boardcertified specialist but has a lot of wildlifeavian related experience including an internship at a wildlife center i would guess she consults with various specialists on individual cases depending on the need eg surgery ophthalmology radiology i would suspect most bird sanctuaries are not well enough funded to have a veterinarian on staff so they probably have relationships with local avianexotics vets who would likely be nonboarded or else abvp avian boarded who spend most of their time with pet birds but consult with the sanctuary as needed if there is a close enough vet school with a zooexoticswildlife department that would also be a common route basically making a career out of mostly or exclusively working with native wild birds in a sanctuaryrehab environment is an extremely niche and likely very lowpaying path most who end up in that situation probably spent a lot of time carving out a custom path to it with a decent amount of luck along the way as opposed to following some wellestablished path hitting standard goalpostsbenchmarks

chompomonim,"This is a very good catch and a problem we discussed a lot internally during the last half a year.  


Mysterium always wanted to have hundreds of thousands exit nodes. In such case, banning all of them is not that easy, because new ones will always appear in the network. So if corporations would try to ban Mysterium network they would also ban own users. That's why mysterium‚Äôs residential nodes are already being used by 5 centralised VPNs as well as in two dVPN applications.  


To acquire hundreds of thousands exit nodes we‚Äôre working on ‚Äúdual-mode‚Äù solution, when Mysterium desktop app users could click a button and start providing Mysterium services in the same time. All they‚Äôll  earn will be toppet into their account balance so technically they will have ‚Äúfree VPN credits‚Äù for own usage.  


However governments already proved that they can afford to ban even millions of foreighn residential IP addresses, so entering into the Mysterium network from those censorship heavy countries may be complicated.  


Vlad, our lead protocol architect already created a few improvement proposals on how to approach this problem in a good way. This is quite a big part of Mysterium 2.0 engineering innovation. In general there are two main approaches to this solution.  


1. Don‚Äôt allow to fetch all the IP addresses. It should be both expensive and even not possible to do from similar IP range. This would allow bots (both corporations and governments) to fetch only part of a network's IPs and pay for that in the same time.
2. Introduce censorship resistance component into network which would serve as entrance proxy into network. So even if exit nodes would be banned by ISP, this ‚Äúcensorship resistance component‚Äù would allow people to join network and then jump into one of exit nodes.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,this is a very good catch and a problem we discussed a lot internally during the last half a year mysterium always wanted to have hundreds of thousands exit nodes in such case banning all of them is not that easy because new ones will always appear in the network so if corporations would try to ban mysterium network they would also ban own users thats why mysterium‚Äôs residential nodes are already being used by centralised vpns as well as in two dvpn applications to acquire hundreds of thousands exit nodes we‚Äôre working on ‚Äúdualmode‚Äù solution when mysterium desktop app users could click a button and start providing mysterium services in the same time all they‚Äôll earn will be toppet into their account balance so technically they will have ‚Äúfree vpn credits‚Äù for own usage however governments already proved that they can afford to ban even millions of foreighn residential ip addresses so entering into the mysterium network from those censorship heavy countries may be complicated vlad our lead protocol architect already created a few improvement proposals on how to approach this problem in a good way this is quite a big part of mysterium engineering innovation in general there are two main approaches to this solution don‚Äôt allow to fetch all the ip addresses it should be both expensive and even not possible to do from similar ip range this would allow bots both corporations and governments to fetch only part of a networks ips and pay for that in the same time introduce censorship resistance component into network which would serve as entrance proxy into network so even if exit nodes would be banned by isp this ‚Äúcensorship resistance component‚Äù would allow people to join network and then jump into one of exit nodes

\- There used to be a partnership with the Sentinel DVPN, as in allow users to use each others nodes. Is this still planned?

CatPolitics101,"I would look into the animal shelter where you currently work for any job openings as a vet assistant. Your biggest strength will be your ability to handle/restrain animals, so focus on that. There is no shame in using muzzles until you are 100% comfortable. 

After you get some experience, then look into jobs at a GP. Working in GP will allow you to broaden your experience further with more complex surgeries and routine vet care. Working in GP will also allow you more time to go back to school if you decide to do so. 

Now, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go into emergency medicine. I switched from GP to ER 2 years ago and I'll never go back. I'm not licensed (yet), but I still get to do most hands on things, except for what only a licensed tech can do. I focus primarily on inpatient care, so I perform venipuncture, administer medications and treatments, monitor anesthesia, scrub in for surgery, take radiographs, you name it. I make $25 an hour currently and am on track to make $27 by the end of next year. I only make this amount because I work in ER, GP usually pays less. 

I also made the change from corporate America 4 years ago, and I've never looked back. There is a hell of a learning curve, and often pushback depending on your clinic, but it has been so rewarding.

sfchin98,"Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say ""one of my parents works in human medicine"" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. 

And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay.

MYST_team,"Hi u/Sebsebzen, Thanks for your great questions and for being a long-time supporter. I‚Äôll work my answers from top to bottom:  


1. The Mysterium VPN team operates as a different project and team, and their focus is to scale their commercial-grade apps and generate revenue like any other business. This is to ensure the permanent viability of the whole project without reliance on external funding sources.

2. Both Robertas and Jaro are still active supporters of the original Mysterium project and other than being advisors, they contribute to and collaborate on specific areas. They are just not public-facing facing :) Btw, Jaro is not actually a founder, just an early team member.

3. We believe we‚Äôre very competitive against bigger players like NordVPN, not just in terms of pricing but in the value you are receiving. We‚Äôre much more affordable and flexible, PLUS we also have the greatest number of countries available to connect to - over 130 - more than any other VPN provider (that we know of‚Ä¶). We want users to have a truly global internet experience so we‚Äôll keep adding more locations wherever we can.

4. We have a core team of 8 and a larger number of supporting engineers and contributors.

5. Sorry to hear this - maybe this is an issue with your firewall, and a change in your network setup may help.

Jereld," Thanks again. I have a spare M1 MacMini, so I am putting it to use and running everything as Docker containers where I can. I also have a Synology NAS that I am going to move some of these containers over to (especially the ones that don't have native Apple silicon support).

It wasn't Filecoin, that looks much more polished than whatever I was running. It gelt like it was still very early on as a product. Again, the fact that I cannot find anything about it, remember it's name, hell...I don't even know what wallet it was going to, that has me thinking it died off.

But speaking of Filecoin. When I google around that seems to be the first thing that comes up, and the most popular.

calliopeReddit,"> Is it because I said no to coming on my days off? Im just setting my boundaries. 

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,is it because i said no to coming on my days off im just setting my boundaries yes and i think you set your boundaries in the wrong place you say youre trying to learn and improve but you twice told him that you werent willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve he has a right not to expect you to work on your days off but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off and i understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating hes reasonably expecting you to continue learning when youre off the clock especially being as new in the profession as you are so i think youre shooting yourself in the foot you are right that you dont have to do it on your day off but dont expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving if youd been out or years and he made the same request id have a different answer but at month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when youre not at work this is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them and hes not making any money off of the time hes asking you to donate

calliopeReddit,"Yes, relief work is a good way to travel as a vet, but you would need a license in every jurisdiction where you would practice.   That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

Giraffefab19,"I'm at Virginia-Maryland and it can be a mixed bag but overall pretty good. We do big integrated classes that focus on body systems instead of discrete classes like anatomy, histopathology, etc. An example: the class is called ""Moving"" and focuses on the musculoskeletal system. You spend the first week learning anatomy and physiology of the appendicular skeleton for dogs, cats, and horses. Then the next weeks you start talking about the major issues affecting those structures and how to diagnose and treat them. It's very practical but sometimes feels rushed. The entire curriculum is set up so that important topics are revisited multiple times over the three years to increase your understanding. It works pretty well. I also liked getting to start clinics between second and third year. It gave me a good idea of what clinical year would be like and I loved my equine rotation so much that I decided to take more equine classes third year, which I really enjoyed.


The administration could really be a lot better about communicating things to the students. There's typically some chaos around scheduling and requirements being somewhat unclear whenever a deadline starts approaching. This is mostly because there are only two or three people managing all the correspondence with all the students so they're overwhelmed. They do their best and the communication issues usually doesn't cause any problems more than adding unnecessary stress to people. The curriculum design is good and effective but I'm finding the third year classes repetitive (which is the point) and a little boring. I suppose that's a good problem to have. Most of the rotations for clinical year are pretty good learning experiences with reasonable hours with a few notable exceptions where the faculty are super into academic hazing. My understanding is that administration is trying to crack down on them with little effect.

sfchin98,"""Recognized"" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic ""specialists"" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.

To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty.

herbaceous12,"You‚Äôre not being a crybaby. You‚Äôre dealing with a very difficult situation very well. This is not normal and I would say all this shouldn‚Äôt be expected of you. You should be very proud of yourself for how well you‚Äôve managed and the positive feedback you‚Äôve received clearly shows your ability to handle the situation, but that doesn‚Äôt justify your employer putting you in the situation to begin with. It may be worth requesting a meeting with your boss to discuss the situation. Tell them your concerns, tell them you‚Äôre struggling and request more support. There are plenty of jobs out there, it may also be worth looking elsewhere or emailing a few practices to see what options you have. The OV training is time consuming - if they‚Äôre expecting you to do it they should be giving you adequate time in which to complete it. It‚Äôs not necessarily too much for someone 15 months out, but it‚Äôs a lot of extra paperwork and pressure and it sounds like that‚Äôs something you could do without at this present moment. Contact your friends from vet school and speak to them - are they in similar situations? It may help to sound it out with others, and it‚Äôs a good opportunity to reconnect and chat socially.

meowfricky,"I‚Äôm truly surprised that some people are not understanding that it‚Äôs not how the techs necessarily feel about you, it‚Äôs about the lack of respect. 

I‚Äôd be feeling angry, in your situation. 

I‚Äôm at a tech of 10+ years. I feel like I‚Äôve worked with enough techs who think that they know more than anyone due to their years of experience. I‚Äôve also worked with techs who thought that they knew better because they have more experience in schooling. None of that should matter. 

You‚Äôre a doctor and they need to respect that. 

I kind of experienced something similar when I stepped in to a management role, with staff no respecting. Although it‚Äôs kind of nerve wracking at first, I kind of had to separate being friendly and being a leader and having the ultimate say. It didn‚Äôt take long for people to respect me after that. 

Perhaps in your situation, when the tech refuses to call you doctor, you could say ‚Äúplease refer to me as dr___.‚Äù 

Also- delegate. Stay on top of the techs to make sure they are doing what you asked. 
You can correct them, if needed too.

With that being said I still have to take out max loans. I'm doing ok with about 1k left over from loans at the end of each semester. Over the summer I was given a research grant of about 6.5k which was incredibly helpful too. 

I work at an ER every weekend and use that as my spending money for me, I was able to ask for a pretty good hourly rate (19/hr after shift dif) so again, your mileage may vary on what you can get. But I know a couple people who either work at the school or outside. 

As we move into my third year I'm definitely running low on savings, I don't eat out much but still find the time to have social events as well. 

Bit of a ramble but hopefully a bit of a look into another student's life? Maybe some is applicable, but of course we are all individuals.

MYST_team,"Hey u/nctr thanks for your questions!  
  
\- **any upcoming partnerships with other VPNs to sell them bandwidth?**  
B2B sales is not currently a focus of the Mysterium VPN team. We‚Äôre prioritizing our global userbase and providing them with the best user experience and support.  
  
**- Is currently the number of nodes or the numbers of bandwidth users (internal or from external partners?) the bottleneck? What are you doing to make it less of a bottleneck?**  
I‚Äôm unsure what you mean by bottleneck - right now Mysterium VPN team is utilizing a large number of residential IPs from Mysterium‚Äôs node network, with more locations and residential IPs than our top competitors combined. So now we just need to spread awareness of these new VPN apps and show the world what a great enhancement it is to our lives ;)   
  
**- There used to be a partnership with the Sentinel DVPN, as in allow users to use each others nodes. Is this still planned?**  
Mysterium Network collaborated with Sentinel back in the day to form the dVPN Alliance. Sentinel has since pivoted to a new network (Cosmos) while the original Mysterium Dark app uses Polygon to facilitate its P2P transactions. Something for the MystNodes team to consider in future.  
  
\- **Any plan for whitelabel VPNs? As in I create my own website, design and possibly GUI for my VPN company, but pay mysterium in the backend to be able to use their servers?** Possibly with a generic GUI that can simply be rebranded to my own brand.  
  
We use the open-source Mysterium protocol so in theory you could also create your own VPN app using a direct integration of Mysterium Node (check out their GitHub).  
  
But our team may consider white labeling our VPN 2.0 app in the future.

Hotsaucex11,"So lets start from a reasonable baseline that I hope we can agree on: client communication is an incredibly important aspect of the job and it makes sense for your boss to want to evaluate/train you in this regard. Assuming your boss is actually good at teaching this stuff then this could be some of the most valuable training you ever receive.

So the real question is how you expect them to reasonably accomplish that. Would you prefer them to be in the room with you in-person evaluating/training you while you do exams? Is that better or worse than cameras? Is that a better solution from your boss's POV wrt their time/availability? Maybe they are typically doing other work when you are seeing appointments and are going to be reviewing this stuff at other times.

I completely understand being uncomfortable, but your boss isn't doing anything remotely wrong here. You are uneasy b/c you are being evaluated/trained in an area where you probably do need it (virtually all new grads do). That's just normal human emotion in any similar circumstance.

proximalhistadine,"hi- surgeon here (non-boarded), who has spent a lot of time in shelters and academia in my career. 

&#x200B;

A. cat spay- ovarian pedicle tie on EVERY cat. yes, even pregnant ones. uterine body (single miller's knot), body wall (single inverted cruciate), skin (buried cruciate). larger incisions (pregnant cats)- continuous pattern in the body wall)

 the rigdon-brestle paper had almost 16,000 cats (SIXTEEN THOUSAND- no vet study has that kind of power, we are lucky to get to 100 on a good day) that were spayed with pedicle ties with a minuscule complication rate. this included students performing the spays. pedicle ties are INCREDIBLY safe. remember, ""time is trauma."" the more time spent under anesthesia, the higher the rate of complications. and as i said earlier- i use it on pregnant cats and pyometras as well. cat vessels are very small with no fat on them.  the humane alliance has good videos, as does youtube. you might even find some of my instructional videos if you look hard enough  ;) 

&#x200B;

B. Cat neuter- cord tie/pedicle tie. scrotal. no sutures at all. i aim for closed, but sometimes the tunic is opened and then it becomes open, but whatever. 

&#x200B;

C. dog spay- single miller's knot on ovarian pedicles (have toyed with auto ligation on a  few puppies, but never have as they aren't near as distensible as cats; however, i bet there a select few where it could work). the uterine body gets either a miller's knot (small dogs/puppies) or a double modified transfixation ligature (i tie a modified transfixation ligature on one side, then perform that on the contralateral side). continuous in the skin (or inverted cruciate if the dog is small enough for a single ligature to close the body wall).  then subq and skin (intradermal)

&#x200B;

D. dog neuter- pre-scrotal. closed.  single miller's knot on cord. subq and skin closed in two layers= inverted cruciate and then a buried cruciate or continuous and intradermal, depending on size

D1- young small breeds- i will autoligate the cords after making a transverse incision across the scrotum. skin closed  with skin glue

D3- there is a paper out there regarding scrotal castrations in adults dogs and it mentions leaving the skin open. DO NOT DO THIS. clients get awfully upset as this leaks fluids for days. i had a vet that did this and had to have her stop bc of so many client complaints. i think a scrotal approach is totally fine, but close the skin in dogs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

as far as suture - remember, we need to think about the strength of sure and how long it lasts. monocryl (polilgecaprone-25) is functionally gone in like 2 weeks (50% of it's tensile strength is lost in that time) so it is NOT appropriate for the body wall fascia as failure leads to small hernias or catastrophic failure with guts falling on the floor  at worst. it's great where you don't need it to last as long (completely absorbed in 3-4 months)- so subq and skin. also great for bladders and intestines. PDS (polydioxannone) last a longggg time (50% tensile strength in 6 weeks and complete absorption in 6 months). so it's great for fascia, not so great for intradermals. not bad per se, but not great. for dog spays, i will happily use two packs of suture (PDS for the pedicles/uterus and body wall and monocryl for sub and skin). however, for cat spays, as i only tie three ligatures, i will put PDS in the skin bc that's a waste to open two packs.   


and just to add confusion,  i actually use biosyn (gylcomer 631) and maxon (polyglyconate), coviden's answer to monocryl and PDS, respectively. biosyn gives you three weeks before 50% of the tensile strength is lost, and maxon has the same dissolution characteristics (though it's not as ""smooth"") as PDS. and maxon actually has better knot security by a small margin compared to PDS). one of the big reasons why i use these sutures in my clinic is the cost. these are human-grade sutures, unlike that cheap-ass generic PDS and monocryl (like one-dox, one-cryl, etc). i hate that generic shit- the cartridges suck and lock up, the dye comes off on your cloves. it's really shitty suture.

chompomonim," I'd like clarify a little timeline behind tokenomics 2.0 and node staking.   
Tokenomics 2.0 staking (when node have to stake own or borrowed MYST to receive traffic) will be introduced only in end of Q1 2022. All current calculations of 1 MYST stake to receive $0.01 DAI is just preview of what is comming rather than something node runners will need to do right after mainnet launch.  
In upcoming Mainnet release, new nodes will have to stake some small amount of MYST (between 0.1MYST and 10MYST) to proof skin in the game and cover registration tx fee (pay for Polygon gas). This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.  


**Tokenomics 1.0 staking:**

* proofs that node is puting skin in the game and is not just random bot sending proposals
* will guarantee that hermes is always ready to settle (important for those who'd like to do very rare settlements and withdrawals --> saving blockchain tx fees) 
* will increase node's changes being higher in smart (re)connect selection --> more likely to get sessions

Affectionate-Owl183,"Lafebervet is wonderful for free CE regarding exotics (both at the tech and doctor level). Also don't be afraid to ask to shadow an exotics doc for a week or so. It may not seem like long, but it'll be very enlightening. Most GPs or ER doctors who approach them as if they're a cat or a dog do them a disservice. There are so many that visit us having come from doctors who never gave them solid husbandry advice, misdiagnosed them, missed something that the species is known for having (such as dental disease in rabbits) or just inappropriate meds/therapies altogether. I understand they're ""trying"" but honestly you really have to familiarize yourself with these species just as much as you would a cat or dog if you intend to see them. There's no way to just ""casually"" treat a few exotics a year without compromising the level of care.

Examples:

1) Spoke with a lady today. Her rabbit is MORBIDLY obese. Like I'd be concerned to put it under anesthesia. She saw her other vet for 7 years. They never mentioned this, and never asked what she fed or told her that she should not be free feeding pellets OR that she should have stopped having an alfalfa-based pellet at 6 months when he matured. Also didn't tell her to spay them (they have a notoriously high incidence of metastatic repro cancer after about 4 years of age).

2) I saw a rabbit that had multiple holes in its face through our ER. Their vet was trying to ""drain"" the abscesses on its face (this is not appropriate in rabbits, their pus is solid). Did not attempt to address underlying dental issues that were causing the abscesses.

3) 10yr old African grey that had wellness exams one and off over the years with their GP. The bird ""seized"" nearly every visit. They were told it was stress. Parrots are extremely known for atherosclerosis but this was never mentioned. By the time it had ""the big one"" (the stroke that finally brought it in through ER as opposed to the more minor ones it was having while hypertensive during handling events)...it's vasculature on radiographs looked AWFUL. It died in hospital. It's possible that sooner therapy and recognition would have helped.

4) Every decrepit reptile that's ever been seen by someone who doesn't know reptiles well and arrives drier than a raisin in the Sahara because not one vet told them that reptiles take up most of their hydration through their vent and actually need to be physically soaked in water. Seriously the amount of things that come in for kidney failure because they've spent their whole life dry. So sad.

5) 2 year old snake that had an under tank heater. Was seen elsewhere. Owners were told that the funny looking patch on its belly was just a ""rough shed"" by an RDVM. It came in approximately two days later for ""not eating"". This was because it wasn't a rough shed. It had third degree burns along the ventrum because O's hadn't placed the under tank heat far enough from the glass, and the snake was a burrowing species.

On Mysterium VPN 2.0, your assigned IP address refreshes at every connection and you can also manually refresh the IP address in case of any issue with your current IP address.

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.  That means new grads have a choice:  They can be excited to learn and improve to help their career, or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isn't paying them to do so.",2024-05-18 22:37:09.776679,[],n/a,it‚Äôs not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off i agree its also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when theyre on the job or to put it another way i wouldnt want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid new grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when theyre not on the clock and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive that means new grads have a choice they can be excited to learn and improve to help their career or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isnt paying them to do so

Icy_External6132,"Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way! 

Good luck!
